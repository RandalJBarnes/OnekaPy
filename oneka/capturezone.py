Error

Functions
---------
compute_capturezone(
        xtarget, ytarget, rtarget, npaths, duration,
        pfield, umbra, weight,

    Compute the capture zone for the target well.

    Arguments
    ---------
    xtarget : float
        The x-coordinate of the target well [m].

    ytarget : float
        The y-coordinate of the target well [m].

    rtarget : float
        The radius of the target well [m]. 0 < rtarget.

    npaths : int
        The minimum number of paths (starting points for the backtraces)
        to generate uniformly around the target well. 0 < npaths.

    duration : float
        The duration of the capture zone [d]; e.g. a ten year capture zone
        will have a duration = 10*365.25. 0 < duration.

    pfield : probabilityfield
        The auto-expanding, axis-aligned, grid-based probability field.

    weight : float
        The pseudo-probability associated with the capture zone.

    umbra : float
        The vector-to-raster range [m] when mapping a particle path onto
        the ProbabilityField grids. If a grid node is within umbra of a
        particle path, it is marked as visited.

    tol : float
        The tolerance [m] for the local error when solving the backtrace
        differential equation. This is an inherent parameter for an
        adaptive Runge-Kutta method. 0 < tol.

    maxstep : float
        The maximum allowed step in space [m] when solving the backtrace
        differential equation. This is NOT the maximum time step. 0 < maxstep.

    feval : function
        The backtracing velocity function: [Vx, Vy] = feval(x, y).

    Returns
    -------
    None.

    Notes
    -----
    o   This capture zone is not stochastic.

    Notes
    -----
    o   This function use the Dormand-Prince implementation of an
        adaptive Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve the backtrace ode.
        See, for example,

            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand-Prince_method

    o   Much of the Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta code is translated
        and adpated from the MATLAB implementation given by
        www.mathtools.com.

    o   This implementation is unique is two significant ways:

        --  The feval is NOT a function of time, as we are working
            with steadystate flow.

        --  The maximum time step is governed by a maximum space step.

    o   The Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta is currently the default method
        in MATLAB's ode45, as well as SciPy's ode integration library.
